These results actually occur in 9-dimensional space, so a 6 degree Principal Component Analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of each vector to 3 so that they could be pictured in these figures. For this reason, some of the detail gets lost, but the clusters are all still discernable. In Section 4\hbox {} we will find (d), where $k = 9$, to be the preferred clustering analysis, hence it is colored differently than the rest of the plots.\relax }}{9}}

It is a common method of evaluation used in addition to the FPC. This plot shows the silhouette values for each value of $k$. Note that the cluster values range from $[2,7]$. These are offset by $-3$ so a cluster value of 5 on the chart shows $k = 5 + 3 = 8$. In general, the closer the silhouette value is to 1, the better the fit of the model. \relax }}{10}}
